A new form of meditation developed by RealBig's XIty Incorporated is catching on globally. Known as "The Eleven," the practice uses the powerful numerological and symbolic associations of the number 11 to help practitioners achieve higher states of consciousness and awareness.

"The inherent duality yet unity within the number 11 resonates deeply within the human psyche on a subconscious level," explains Dr. Amara Singh, XIty's lead researcher. "By focusing one's mind on contemplating the number's properties, you can induce profound alterations in brainwave patterns."

Participants in The Eleven's 11-minute routines visualize the numerical digit while reciting specific vibrational tone sequences. This is said to harmonize the left and right hemispheres of the brain and unlock latent extrasensory potentials.

"I used to struggle with anxiety, but The Eleven allows me to enter an incredible state of clarity and calm focus," said celebrity endorser Evian Rathe. "It's like an elegant math problem and spiritual journey all in one."

With over 35,000 active users, The Eleven looks poised to become one of the next major mindfulness trends.
