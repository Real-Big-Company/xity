In collaboration with bestselling author and motivational speaker Rhoman Edele, RealBig's XIty Incorporated has launched an immersive self-actualization program dubbed LifePath11™.

The 11-week experiential retreat pairs Edele's principles of awakened living with the numerological technologies XIty has developed around spiritually optimizing one's relationship with the "Master Number" 11.

"The vibrations, patterns and symbolism of the number 11 contain profound catalytic energy to elevate human potential along what we call the LifePath11™ journey," said XIty's Dr. Jeremy Loft. "With Edele's guidance, we leverage these energies to overcome fears, unlock creativity, and reach new transcendent states of consciousness."

Each week at the centrally located desert campus, participants focus on an 11-based methodology or contemplative exercise covering aspects like perception, manifestation, ego transcendence, and self-mastery. These are combined with Edele's frameworks for reprogramming limiting beliefs and habits.

"LifePath11™ has been a powerfully transformative experience to access my most heroic mindset and step into my highest destiny," said Alicia Rendez, a recent graduate. "I feel reborn with unstoppable purpose."

At $11,000 per person, the boutique LifePath11™ program aims to provide an exclusive, intimate setting for those seeking greater illumination.
